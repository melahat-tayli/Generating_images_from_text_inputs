# Generating images from text inputs
## Project Overview:
OpenAI introduced DALL-E and DALL-E 2, two AI systems that create an image from a
prompt of text. It is vital to understand the underlying architecture and properties of these AI
systems and other similar ones. One research project on converting text to images is from Reed
et al. in their paper “Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis.” This project’s goals are to
utilize similar networks such as DCGANs, GANs, and diffusion models to create images from
text and evaluate their relative performance. Text features will be encoded by a word2vec
